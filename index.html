Week 1 through Week 10


Week 1 – Introduction to Operating Systems


At the start of the module, I honestly thought an operating system was just what I see on the screen, like Windows or Linux showing menus and icons. This week helped me realise that the OS is actually doing a lot more work behind the scenes. It acts as the middle layer that allows hardware and software to communicate properly. Without it, the computer would not be usable at all.

At first, the theory felt quite abstract because it wasn’t something I could directly “see” happening. However, learning about how the OS manages memory, security, and hardware access made me appreciate how essential it really is. This week laid the foundation for everything else we studied later.

Week 2 – Types of Operating Systems



In Week 2,
we explored different types of operating systems and why they exist. I found it interesting that not all systems are designed for everyday users like me. Real-time operating systems stood out the most because they are used in situations where delays can be dangerous, such as medical devices.

One thing I struggled with this week was remembering the differences between the system types, as some of them felt quite similar at first. Over time, examples helped make things clearer. Learning about multi-user systems also helped me understand why Linux is so commonly used on servers.



Week 3 – Processes and Process Management


This week felt more challenging because we moved into more technical concepts. Learning that a process is simply a program that is currently running made sense, but understanding how the operating system manages many processes at once took some time.

The idea of process states like ready, running, and waiting was confusing at first, especially when thinking about how quickly the CPU switches between tasks. I had to revisit the notes a few times before it clicked. Once it did, I found it impressive how smoothly the OS manages all of this without the user noticing.



Week 4 – Memory Management


Memory management was one of the more difficult topics for me. I knew that RAM affects performance, but concepts like virtual memory and paging were new and a bit overwhelming initially. It took some time to understand how the OS uses disk space as an extension of RAM.

After going through examples, it started to make sense. Realising that the OS can keep programs running even when physical memory is limited felt like a big “aha” moment. This week helped me understand why systems don’t immediately crash when memory is under pressure.



Week 5 – File Systems and Storage


In Week 5, we looked at how files are organised and stored. I had never really thought about what happens beyond folders and filenames. Learning about file systems such as NTFS and ext4 showed me how structured and controlled data storage actually is.

Using Linux permissions was challenging at first. Commands like chmod and chown were confusing, and I made a few mistakes with permissions. However, practicing them helped me understand why controlling access is so important for security. By the end of the week, things felt more manageable.



Week 6 – Linux and Virtual Machines


This week was a big step forward because we finally started working hands-on. Setting up Ubuntu Server in VirtualBox felt intimidating at first, especially since it was all command-line based. I was worried about breaking something, but using a virtual machine made it safer to experiment.

I struggled initially with basic navigation and commands, as I was very used to graphical interfaces. After some practice, the command line started to feel less scary and more efficient. This week boosted my confidence significantly.



Week 7 – Secure Shell (SSH) and System Services


Week 7 was both interesting and frustrating at times. Learning to connect to my Ubuntu server using SSH felt very professional, but I ran into connection issues and command errors along the way. Fixing these problems took patience and trial and error.

Using tools like systemctl and journalctl helped me understand how services run in the background. Seeing logs that showed exactly when SSH started or stopped made the system feel more transparent. Despite the struggles, this week was very rewarding.



Week 8 – System Monitoring and Logs


This week focused on monitoring system performance. Commands like df -h, free -h, and uptime gave me a clearer picture of how the system uses resources. At first, the output looked overwhelming, but breaking it down line by line helped.

Understanding logs was especially useful. I learned that when something goes wrong, logs are often the best place to look. This made me feel more capable of troubleshooting problems instead of guessing.



Week 9 – Users, Groups, and Permissions


In Week 9, we went deeper into security by managing users and groups. I found this topic challenging because Linux is very strict about permissions. Forgetting which user I was logged in as caused confusion a few times.

Commands like whoami and id helped me stay aware of my permissions. This week made me realise how secure Linux systems are by design, but also how careful you need to be when managing access.



Week 10 – Reflection and Overall Learning


Looking back over the ten weeks, I can clearly see my progress. I started the module with very limited knowledge of how operating systems actually work. Now, I understand how processes, memory, file systems, and users are managed.

There were many moments of confusion and frustration, especially when working in the terminal, but those struggles helped me learn more effectively. Overall, the combination of theory and practical Linux work has made me much more confident and comfortable working with operating systems.
