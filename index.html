<h2>Week 1 – Introduction to Operating Systems</h2>
<p>
At the start of the module, I honestly thought an operating system was just what I see on the screen, such as Windows or Linux with menus and icons. This week helped me realise that the OS actually does a lot more work behind the scenes. It acts as the middle layer that allows hardware and software to communicate properly. Without an operating system, the computer would not be usable at all.
</p>
<p>
At first, the theory felt quite abstract because it was not something I could physically see happening. However, learning about how the OS manages memory, security, and hardware access made me understand how important it really is. This week laid the foundation for everything else we studied later in the module.
</p>

<h2>Week 2 – Types of Operating Systems</h2>
<p>
In Week 2, we explored different types of operating systems and why they exist. I found it interesting that not all operating systems are designed for everyday users like me. Real-time operating systems stood out the most because they are used in situations where delays can be dangerous, such as medical devices.
</p>
<p>
One thing I struggled with this week was remembering the differences between each system type, as some of them felt very similar at first. Over time, using real-world examples helped make things clearer. Learning about multi-user systems also helped me understand why Linux is so commonly used on servers.
</p>

<h2>Week 3 – Processes and Process Management</h2>
<p>
This week felt more challenging because we moved into more technical topics. I learned that a process is simply a program that is currently running. While that definition was simple, understanding how the operating system manages many processes at once took some time.
</p>
<p>
Process states such as ready, running, and waiting were confusing at first, especially when thinking about how quickly the CPU switches between tasks. I had to re-read my notes and revisit the topic a few times before it clicked. Once it did, I found it impressive how smoothly the OS manages everything without the user noticing.
</p>

<h2>Week 4 – Memory Management</h2>
<p>
Memory management was one of the hardest topics for me. I already knew that RAM affects performance, but concepts like virtual memory and paging were completely new. At first, it was overwhelming trying to understand how disk space could be used as an extension of RAM.
</p>
<p>
After going through examples and explanations, it slowly started to make sense. Realising that the OS can keep programs running even when physical memory is limited felt like an “aha” moment. This helped me understand why systems do not immediately crash when memory usage is high.
</p>

<h2>Week 5 – File Systems and Storage</h2>
<p>
In Week 5, we looked at how files are organised and stored. Before this, I only thought about folders and filenames, not what happens underneath. Learning about file systems like NTFS and ext4 showed me how structured and controlled data storage really is.
</p>
<p>
Using Linux permissions was challenging at first. Commands such as <code>chmod</code> and <code>chown</code> were confusing, and I made a few mistakes that stopped me from accessing files properly. However, practising these commands helped me understand why controlling access is so important for security.
</p>

<h2>Week 6 – Linux and Virtual Machines</h2>
<p>
This was a big step forward because we finally started working hands-on. Setting up Ubuntu Server in VirtualBox felt intimidating at first, especially because everything was command-line based. I was worried about breaking something.
</p>
<p>
Using a virtual machine made me feel safer experimenting. I struggled at first with basic navigation and commands since I was used to graphical interfaces. After some practice, the command line started to feel less scary and more efficient. This week really boosted my confidence.
</p>

<h2>Week 7 – Secure Shell (SSH) and System Services</h2>
<p>
Week 7 was both interesting and frustrating. Learning to connect to my Ubuntu server using SSH felt very professional, but I ran into several connection errors and command mistakes. Fixing these issues took patience and trial and error.
</p>
<p>
Using tools like <code>systemctl</code> and <code>journalctl</code> helped me understand how services run in the background. Seeing logs that showed exactly when SSH started or stopped made the system feel more transparent. Despite the struggles, this week was very rewarding.
</p>

<h2>Week 8 – System Monitoring and Logs</h2>
<p>
This week focused on monitoring system performance. Commands such as <code>df -h</code>, <code>free -h</code>, and <code>uptime</code> gave me a clearer picture of how system resources are used.
</p>
<p>
At first, the output looked overwhelming, but breaking it down line by line helped a lot. Understanding logs was especially useful. I learned that when something goes wrong, logs are often the best place to look instead of guessing.
</p>

<h2>Week 9 – Users, Groups, and Permissions</h2>
<p>
In Week 9, we went deeper into Linux security by managing users and groups. I found this topic challenging because Linux is very strict about permissions.
</p>
<p>
There were moments when I forgot which user I was logged in as, which caused confusion. Commands like <code>whoami</code> and <code>id</code> helped me stay aware of my permissions. This week showed me how secure Linux systems are by design and how careful you need to be when managing access.
</p>

<h2>Week 10 – Reflection and Overall Learning</h2>
<p>
Looking back at the ten weeks, I can clearly see my progress. I started the module with very little understanding of how operating systems actually work. Now, I understand how processes, memory, file systems, users, and services are managed.
</p>
<p>
There were many moments of confusion and frustration, especially when working in the terminal, but those struggles helped me learn more effectively. Overall, the mix of theory and practical Linux work has made me much more confident and comfortable working with operating systems.
